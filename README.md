## Mass-spec
A couple functions for common mass-spec related calculations.

- `masses.py` calculates the monoisotopic mass of the given molecule (chemical formula).
- `mass_spec.py` (forcefully) works out the atom composition of a fragment peak, given the peak and the molecule's chemical formula).
- `esi.py` works out the charges of two different ion peaks from an ESI spectra and provides the mass of the molecule.
